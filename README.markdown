## Synopsis

The idea of this is to create an application that can simulate two interacting populations of humans and zombies, modeling their behaviors: herding; queueing; fight/flight; food seeking etc. The idea is to see what outcomes are produced based on varying baseline assumptions about their behaviors and physical contraints, and to allow users to modify those starting conditions. There are various game-like interactions that could arise from that framework including:

- achieving equillibrium
- eradicating the zombies
- minimizing human casualties
