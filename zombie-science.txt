Zombie Simulator Documentation

UNITS
Units are metric.
Base distance is 1m.
Based on a max population of 10k, we can start out with a world size of 1km x 1km.
One turn = 1 hour. One day = 24 turns.
Two objects can't occupy the same space; for humanioids this can be represented by not allowing the distance between two humanoids to be less than 1m.
We can start with a roughly 480px square canvas to be iPhone compatible, and have 1px = 2m for the initial scale.
Heading could be noted in degrees (with decimals) clockwise from North

ASSUMPTIONS/PHYSICS:
Humanoids see each other at a range of about 20m.
Humans initially recognize zombies at a range of 1m, which should then gradually increase, maxing out at 10m.
Zombies recognize other humanoids as human or zombie at 10m.
Zombies move at a base speed of 1/3 humans' base speed
